# Data Visualization Project Proposal - All Space Missions from 1957
CS573 Course Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is [All Space Missions from 1957](https://gist.github.com/lintonylin/4f9ba13dc37b7510ea392d95c494f891#file-readme-md)

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a graph about mission status of all rocket companies of all time and it shows that RVSN USSR launches much more rocket than other companies while holding nearly the lowest success rate.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Compare the number of launch missions over years to find the most popular year and the most silence year of space misson.
 * Compare the number of launch mission among countries to find the most successful "space" country.
 * Compare the success rate among countries and companies over years to see whether they're improving or not.
 * Visualize launch mission on a world map with circles corresbonding to countries to show differences among countries

## Sketches

It is based on world map. This visualization will show the comparison among countries and years. We can find the most sucessfull country and the most popular year for lauch missions. And, it can provide us the success rate for countries among years.

## Open Questions

 * It seems too hard to implement the "year" scroll bar. 
 * And it hard to control the size of circles in order to keep an adequate size for all years without overlapping.

## Schedule of Deliverables

 * Task 1: Build a world map with country borders. 
    * Week 1, estimate 5 hours
 * Task 2: Pin the location(Country) of missions on the map, create a pie chart(raw) for each country.
    * Week 2, estimate 8 hours
 * Task 3: Refine pie charts, add "status mission" information. Using color hue for status categories. Using size of pie chart for the number of missions. Adding tooltip to show each company's name, country, missions and success rate.
    * Week 3-4, estimate 12 hours
 * Task 4: Add Timeline, the "CrossFilter" will be my target. Thus, we can select to show information of one year or several years.
    * Week 4-5, estimate 36 hours
